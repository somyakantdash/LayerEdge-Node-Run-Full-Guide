# LayerEdge-Node-Run-Full-Guide

## Introduction
LayerEdge is a decentralized network that boosts Bitcoin’s scalability and efficiency using Zero-Knowledge proofs and BitVM, enabling cheaper, secure transaction settlements for rollups and apps on Bitcoin.

LayerEdge is a decentralized platform built to enhance Bitcoin’s ecosystem by improving scalability, reducing costs, and maintaining security. It uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs and BitVM to aggregate and verify transactions off-chain, settling them on Bitcoin with up to 99% lower blockspace usage and costs. This makes it practical for rollups, blockchains, and decentralized apps to leverage Bitcoin’s robust security without its traditional limitations, like high fees and limited scripting.

## Key Features
- Scalability: Enables efficient transaction processing for broader adoption.
- Cost Reduction: Cuts verification costs significantly in a multi-protocol network.
- Security: Ties all operations to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work trust model.
- Versatility: Supports applications beyond finance, like AI and IoT, via verifiable computation.

## Airdrop Details
- Currently, LayerEdge runs an incentivized testnet (Season 2 ends March 22, 2025), where users earn EDGE points by running nodes and verifying proofs. Its goal is to create a “Bitcoin-backed internet,” extending Bitcoin’s utility to scalable, decentralized systems.
- LayerEdge Season 1 (Jan 22 - Feb 28, 2025) was the first testnet phase, rewarding users with EDGE points for running light nodes (1 point/second, 50hrs uptime required) and completing tasks, testing network stability and decentralization.

### Funding 
LayerEdge raised an undisclosed Pre-Seed round on March 29, 2024, led by Blockchain Founders Fund with five other investors, including BreakOrbit Venture and Paul Taylor, to support its Bitcoin scalability mission.
